Concepts is a command line tool for concept analysis. Concept Analysis helps to analyze the relation between objects with assigned attributes by computing a so-called concept lattice. The concept lattice identifies sets of objects and attributes that are synonymous for each other. For a more details, please see the Wiki.

Because it is implemented in C, this tool compiles almost everywhere. However, if you are interested in more recent developments and better algorithms, consider using [Colibri/Java](http://code.google.com/p/colibri-java/) and [Colibri/ML](http://code.google.com/p/colibri-ml/). Both use a more efficient algorithm; in addition, this algorithm permits to explore only part of a concept lattice which is most useful when working with huge lattices.
